# Svelte Training Log

## Summary

This implementation of my previous training log website utilizes Svelte as a front-end framework. I use reactivity by tagging the table data to the stored data recieved from the server. All functionality is identical from the previous iteration. One addition is the username is now part of the header for the website.

I played around with animations to see what Svelte can do. I certainly didn't push it, but I added a fun effect.

There is also a new color scheme to go with this iteration!
